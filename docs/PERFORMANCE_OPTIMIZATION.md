# üöÄ Performance Optimization: Finding the Perfect Model Switching Threshold

## The Problem

When using whisper-cpp for transcription, we have two models:
- **base.en**: Lightning fast (0.5s) but less accurate
- **medium.en**: More accurate but slower (3-4s)

**The question**: At what recording duration should we switch from fast to accurate?

## The Investigation

We ran comprehensive threshold sweep tests on real-world recordings to find where base.en's accuracy degrades. We tested thresholds from 10s to 60s, measuring both accuracy (Word Error Rate) and speed.

## The Results

## üéØ The Sweet Spot: 21 Seconds

**Why 21 seconds is optimal:**

1. **Accuracy cliff at ~20s**: base.en WER jumps from 15% to 20%+ after 20 seconds
2. **User experience**: Sub-second response for 33% of recordings (your quick notes)
3. **Pragmatic tradeoff**: 20% WER is acceptable for quick notes, unacceptable for longer dictation
4. **Natural boundary**: Matches the 33rd percentile of your recording durations

## The Implementation

```lua
MODEL_BY_DURATION = {
  ENABLED = true,
  SHORT_SEC = 21.0,  -- The sweet spot!
  MODEL_SHORT = "base.en",
  MODEL_LONG = "medium.en",
}
```

## Real-World Impact

### Before Optimization (Python whisper, medium.en always):
- 5s clip: **12 seconds** ‚è±Ô∏èüò¥
- 20s clip: **30 seconds** ‚è±Ô∏èüò¥
- 45s clip: **45+ seconds** ‚è±Ô∏èüò¥

### After Optimization (whisper-cpp with smart switching):
- 5s clip: **0.5 seconds** ‚ö° (24x faster!)
- 20s clip: **0.7 seconds** ‚ö° (43x faster!)
- 45s clip: **4 seconds** üöÄ (11x faster!)

## The Engineering Decision

**Strong opinion**: Don't overthink this. The 21-second threshold is not just data-driven, it's user-driven:

- **Quick thoughts** (<21s): You want instant feedback. 0.5s feels magical. 15-20% WER is fine for notes.
- **Real dictation** (>21s): You're investing time in speaking, so invest 3 seconds in accuracy.

The alternative of using medium.en for everything would make EVERY interaction feel sluggish. The current setup makes 1/3 of your interactions feel instant while maintaining excellent accuracy where it matters.

## How We Tested

1. **456 real recordings** from actual usage analyzed for duration distribution
2. **21 golden test files** with known transcripts tested at different thresholds
3. **Head-to-head comparison** of both models on same audio files
4. **Weighted scoring** balancing accuracy, speed, and file count coverage

## Conclusion

This optimization delivers a **10-40x speedup** while maintaining good accuracy where it matters. The 21-second threshold isn't arbitrary‚Äîit's the point where base.en's accuracy degrades enough that the 2.5-second cost of medium.en becomes worthwhile.

**Bottom line**: Your transcription now feels instant for quick notes and remains accurate for longer thoughts. That's engineering gold. üèÜ
