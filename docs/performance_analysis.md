# Whisper Model Performance Analysis

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance analysis of different Whisper models on our golden dataset, generated using macOS synthetic voices with diverse speaking styles, accents, and technical content.

## Golden Dataset Composition
- **Total Samples**: 21 audio files
- **Categories**: micro (2), short (6), medium (3), long (2), natural (4), challenging (4)
- **Voices**: Daniel, Samantha, Moira (Irish accent), Veena (Indian accent)
- **Styles**: standard, perfect, natural, technical

## Model Comparison Results

### base.en Performance
- **Overall WER**: 19.89%
- **Perfect Transcriptions**: 1/21
- **Best Category**: Short samples (15.5% WER)
- **Worst Category**: Long samples (30.8% WER)
- **Processing Speed**: Fast (typically 3-8 seconds for short clips)

### small.en Performance
- **Overall WER**: 19.19% (3.5% improvement)
- **Perfect Transcriptions**: 2/21
- **Best Category**: Short samples (13.5% WER)
- **Worst Category**: Long samples (30.5% WER)
- **Processing Speed**: Moderate (4-10 seconds for short clips)

## Key Findings

### Challenging Terms Recognition
| Term | base.en | small.en | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| GitHub | 100% | 100% | Consistently recognized |
| JSON | 100% | 100% | Consistently recognized |
| Jira | 100% | 100% | Consistently recognized |
| symlinks | 0% | 0% | Mishears as "sim links" |
| NoSQL | 0% | 0% | Mishears as "no SQL" |
| dedupe | 0% | 0% | Mishears as "deduke" |
| XDG | 0% | 0% | Case sensitivity issues |

### Performance by Speaking Style
- **Perfect Style**: Both models perform best (base: 16.7%, small: 10.7%)
- **Natural Style**: Challenging for both (base: 23.1%, small: 20.0%)
- **Technical Style**: Moderate difficulty (base: 16.3%, small: 19.1%)

### Performance by Voice
- **Samantha**: Best results (base: 14.5%, small: 14.0%)
- **Daniel**: More challenging (base: 24.5%, small: 23.1%)
- **Accented Voices**: Higher WER as expected (Moira: ~28%, Veena: ~12-18%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Dictionary Replacements**: Continue using dictionary replacements for known mishears (symlinks, NoSQL, dedupe)
2. **Model Selection**: Consider small.en for slightly better accuracy with acceptable speed tradeoff
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Add problematic terms to INITIAL_PROMPT configuration

### Future Improvements
1. **Test medium.en**: May provide significant accuracy improvements for long-form content
2. **Fine-tuning**: Consider fine-tuning on technical vocabulary specific to your use case
3. **Post-processing**: Implement context-aware corrections for compound technical terms

## Testing Infrastructure

### Scripts Available
- `generate_golden_dataset_enhanced.sh`: Creates standardized test dataset
- `test_accuracy_enhanced.sh [model]`: Runs comprehensive accuracy tests
- `compare_benchmarks.py`: Compares performance between runs
- `report_short_vs_long.py`: Analyzes refiner impact on long-form content

### Output Artifacts
- Results stored in `tests/results/TIMESTAMP_enhanced/`
- JSON metrics for programmatic analysis
- Detailed per-file transcription comparisons
- Category, style, and voice breakdowns

## Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Baseline Establishment**: ✅ Complete with golden dataset
2. **Model Benchmarking**: ✅ base.en and small.en tested
3. **Dictionary Optimization**: In progress
4. **Refiner Integration**: Available for long-form content
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Ready for automation

## Performance Targets

- **Short content (<30 words)**: Target <10% WER
- **Medium content (30-60 words)**: Target <15% WER  
- **Long content (>60 words)**: Target <20% WER
- **Technical terms**: Target >90% accuracy for common terms
