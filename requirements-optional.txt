# Optional Python Dependencies
# 
# IMPORTANT: These are OPTIONAL and NOT required for core functionality.
# The system works perfectly with just whisper-cpp (C++ implementation).
#
# If you need these Python tools, install via pipx for isolation:
#   brew install pipx
#   pipx ensurepath
#   pipx install <package-name>
#
# DO NOT use pip directly - pipx provides isolated environments.

# Speech-to-text transcription (fallback, being replaced by whisper-cpp)
openai-whisper>=20230918

# Punctuation restoration for transcripts (optional)
deepmultilingualpunctuation>=1.0.0

# Note: Do NOT install these with pip directly.
# Use pipx to maintain isolation:
#   brew install pipx
#   pipx ensurepath
#   pipx install openai-whisper
#   pipx install deepmultilingualpunctuation
